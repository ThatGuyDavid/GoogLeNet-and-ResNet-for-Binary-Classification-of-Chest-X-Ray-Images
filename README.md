# Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Models

## **Description**
This project focuses on building a **binary classification model** to detect pneumonia using the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The dataset contains **5,863 labeled X-ray images** categorized into two classes:
- **NORMAL**: Healthy chest X-rays.
- **PNEUMONIA**: Chest X-rays showing signs of pneumonia.

The objective is to develop and compare two deep learning models, **GoogLeNet** and **ResNet**, to classify X-ray images into these two categories. This project involves:
- Preprocessing and splitting the data.
- Training and fine-tuning the models.
- Evaluating and comparing performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**.
- Visualizing results with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## **Dataset**
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and consists of the following:
- **Train Set**: Used for model training.
- **Validation Set**: Used for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Test Set**: Used for final evaluation.

## **Goals**
1. Develop two deep learning models for pneumonia detection:
   - **GoogLeNet**
   - **ResNet**
2. Compare the models' performance and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.
3. Provide insights into the applicability of deep learning for medical imaging tasks.
